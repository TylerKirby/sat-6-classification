# SAT-6 Classification Project
The goal of this project is to build robust classifiers for the SAT-6 dataset. There are 4 notebooks in the project demonstrate the process for creating the classifiers:

1. `eda.ipynb`: The exploratory data analysis notebook. Here are the data exploration notes, visualizations, and a simple baseline model.
2. `cnn.ipynb`: A deep convolutional neural network trained on SAT-6.
3. `cnn_eval.ipynb`: An exploration of the neural network trained in `cnn.ipynb`.
4. `vae.ipynb`: A variational autoencoder trained on SAT-6.
5. `vae_eval`: An exploration of the autoencoder and its resulting vector space created in `vae.ipynb`.
